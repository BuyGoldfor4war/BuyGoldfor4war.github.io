            <p>Hello! I am Esteban Mann, a passionate and creative front-end developer. My goal is to create interactive and visually appealing web experiences that combine solid functionality with attractive design. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, from corporate websites and online stores to web applications and user interface development.</p>
            <p>My approach is based on a combination of technical skills and a solid understanding of user experience. I strive to thoroughly understand the needs and goals of my clients and use that information to develop web solutions that provide a smooth and engaging user experience. I am proud to say that my work has helped businesses and organizations improve their online presence and deliver exceptional experiences to their users.</p>
            <p>My skill set includes expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the use of popular frameworks and libraries such as React and Angular. I am constantly updating and learning new technologies and tools to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in front-end development.</p>
            <p>In my portfolio, you will find a selection of my best projects, showcasing examples of my skills in responsive user interface development, implementation of animations and interactive effects, and website performance optimization. Each project has been developed with attention to detail and a focus on usability and user experience.</p>
